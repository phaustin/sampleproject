  summary: A sample Python project
  description: 'A sample Python project

    =======================


    This is the description file for the project.


    The file should use UTF-8 encoding and be written using ReStructured Text. It

    will be used to generate the project webpage on PyPI, and should be written for

    that purpose.


    Typical contents for this file would include an overview of the project, basic

    usage examples, etc. Generally, including the project changelog in here is not

    a good idea, although a simple "What''s New" section for the most recent version

    may be appropriate.'
